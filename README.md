All Python Experiments (1-15)
Python Experiment List (Semester IV - SE IT)
Experiment 1:
1.1 Write a Python program to compute the future value of a specified principal amount, rate of interest, and number of years.
1.2 Write a Python program to print the largest of three numbers.

Experiment 2:
2.1 Write a Python program that reads the month and year and prints the season for that month and year.
2.2 Write a Python program to display even and odd numbers from 1 to n.
2.3 Write a Python program that prints the first n Fibonacci numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...).

Experiment 3:
3.1 Write a Python program to check whether a number is prime.
3.2 Write a Python program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.
3.3 Write a Python program to find the sum of the digits of a number.

Experiment 4:
4.1 Write a Python class named Circle constructed by a radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.
4.2 Write a Python class named Polygon with two attributes: no_of_sides and display_sides. Inherit a class Triangle from Polygon and calculate the area of a triangle.
